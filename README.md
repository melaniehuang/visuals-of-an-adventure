Using the data collected on my European trip - I'm going to attempt, attempt being the key word, to create an abstract representation of the data to live on a screen in our living room. 

Here goes nothing.

Divided data into two groups:

Countries:
  * dateArr
  * dateDep
  * place
  * type
  * latitude
  * longitude
  * main flag colors(color1, color2, color3)

 Events(City, Home, Restaurant, Attraction, Moment):
  * dateArr
  * dateDep
  * place
  * type
  * latitude
  * longitude
  * country

And hopefully somewhere near the end of it, I can release a version where anyone can enter their own data and colours to create their own piece.
